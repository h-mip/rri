<h3>Nuremberg Code</h3>
<ol><small>
<li>Voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential</li>
<li>The experiment must yield generalizable knowledge that could not be obtained in any other way and is not random and unnecessary in nature</li>
<li>Animal experimentation should precede human experimentation</li>
<li>All unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury should be avoided</li>
<li>No experiment should be conducted if there is reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur</li>
<li>The degree of risk to subjects should never exceed the humanitarian importance of the problem</li>
<li>Risks to the subjects should be minimized through proper preparations</li>
<li>Experiments should only be conducted by scientifically qualified investigators</li>
<li>Subjects should always be at liberty to withdraw from experiments</li>
<li>Investigators must be ready to end the experiment at any stage if there is cause to believe that continuing the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability or death to the subject</li>

Over the next 20 days, he was sleep deprived, slammed against his prison door, imprisoned in a box and waterboarded 83 times . . . . Later, when Zubaydah was said to have “partially” refused liquids, the CIA Office of Medical Services’ own physicians administer[ed] a series of rectal enemas whose sole purpose was to violate and degrade. In other words, Zubaydah was not only tortured, he was medically raped.</i></li>

<li><i>We show, via a massive (N = 689,003) experiment on Facebook, that emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.</i></li>
